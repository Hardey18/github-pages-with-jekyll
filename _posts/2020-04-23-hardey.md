# About Me

I am a graduate of Building Technology who has acquired extensive knowledge in the field through the study of **Building Production Management**. I have previous work experience in establishing building requirements and also have a flair for design using AutoCAD and Revit.

I have strong desire for technology and I wish to build a career in **Software Development**. I am eager to be challenged in order to grow and further improve my skills.

My passion is using my technical ability to benefit other people and organizations.
